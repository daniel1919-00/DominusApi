Dominus Api is an object-oriented framework for building web APIs quickly and easily with php 8.

# Installation

You can quickly create a Dominus api backends with the [Dominus CLI](https://github.com/daniel1919-00/DominusCli).

Check out the [Documentation](https://daniel1919-00.github.io/DominusApi/).

# Key features:
* Minimalist architecture: Simplicity gives the framework some advantages over other frameworks.
    * Low overhead
    * Less error-prone
    * Easier to debug
    * Easier to learn
* Easy routing: There are no manual routes to be made. The router is very opinionated and knows exactly where everything is.
* Modular: Controllers, models, and everything related are neatly packed in directories called modules.
* Dependency injection
* Middleware support
* No dependencies out of the box. 
    * Composer is included automatically if the vendor/autoload file exists, but it is not required for the framework to function.
* Tooling: It has its own little cli tools to help you with boilerplate code
